# uPSD_Programmer
program for   <a href="http://www.upsd8051.com/cn/products/proxxzn.asp" rel="nofollow">ST uPSD Microcontroller</a>  it allows programming, reading, verification of microcontrollers using   <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/101455/0100/Hardware-Description/Target-Connectors?lang=en" rel="nofollow">ulink2</a>. The program is created using reverse engineering of original libraries from Keil.
To flash the program, one file with the extension *.obj is enough. Tested in Windows 10 x64 and with the UPSD3233BV microcontroller.
# Some information about the microcontroller family
"ST uPSD microcontroller" refers to a family of 8-bit microcontrollers from STMicroelectronics that incorporate a Flash Programmable System Device (PSD) architecture and an 8032 core. These devices are known for their in-system programmability (ISP) via a JTAG interface. 
Key Features and Characteristics:

   - 8032 Core: The uPSD microcontrollers are based on the 8032 microcontroller core, a popular 8-bit architecture.
   - Flash PSD Architecture: They utilize a Flash PSD architecture, which allows for in-system programming (ISP) of the flash memory.
   - In-System Programming (ISP): This feature allows users to program the microcontroller while it is already soldered onto a circuit board, simplifying manufacturing and allowing for in-field updates.
   - JTAG Interface: The uPSD microcontrollers support ISP through a JTAG interface.
   - Peripheral Set: They include a variety of peripherals, such as UARTs, timers, I/O ports, PWM channels, and an ADC.
   - Programmable Logic: Some uPSD devices include a Programmable Decode Logic (PLD) for flexible address mapping.
   - Memory: They typically feature both Flash memory (main and secondary) and SRAM.
   - Supervisor Functions: They often include supervisor functions like a watchdog timer.
   - Zero-Power Technology: Some uPSD devices are designed with low-power consumption in mind.
